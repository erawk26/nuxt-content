title: Listings Grid Iframe
client: Explore Minnesota
description: This was a custom Drupal module that generates a curated grid of partner listings. First a user fills out a Drupal Webform with their custom configuration. Then Drupal stores that configuration in webforms submission data. Once the form is submitted, the server generates an iframe with a url that is encoded with the webforms submission id. The user is then redirected to a page with code for a custom iframe. They can paste this on their website to show the curated feed that they specifically configured. Check out the links to try it out yourself.
